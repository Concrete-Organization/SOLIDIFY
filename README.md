# ðŸ“± SOLIDIFY APP OVERVIEW

SOLIDIFY is a mobile application developed using Flutter, designed to revolutionize the construction industry in Egypt by addressing the critical issue of poor concrete quality. The app empowers engineers, concrete companies, and material suppliers with AI-powered tools to estimate concrete strength, a marketplace to source quality materials, and a collaborative community for knowledge sharing. By integrating these features, Solidify aims to reduce building collapses, save costs, and promote sustainable construction practices.

## ðŸŽ¨  System Design

The app is built using the Clean Architecture pattern, which promotes separation of concerns and makes the codebase more maintainable and testable. This architecture divides the project into three main layers:

UI Layer: Manages the UI and handles user interactions. This layer includes views and widgets.

Logic Layer: Contains state management of app using (flutter_bloc).

Data Layer: Handles data sources such as APIs. This layer includes data models and repositories.

By using Clean Architecture, the project achieves a clear separation between business logic and UI, making it scalable, testable, and easy to maintain.
